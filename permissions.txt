we make groups and put users in them. Then, based on these groups,
    we decide whether to show a page or not.


model level permissions:




****************** DJANGO DOCS **********************



----- permissions and authorisation:-----

Django comes with a built-in permissions system


we can overwrite 
    has_add_permssions(), has_change_permssions(),
    has_delete_permssions(), has_view_permssions()
 methods provided by the ModelAdmin class, it is possible to
 customize permissions for different object instances of 
 the same type.


User objects have two many-to-many fields: groups 
 and user_permissions





----- Default Permissions ------


When django.contrib.auth is listed in your INSTALLED_APPS,there 
 are 4 types of permissions created for each model in all apps:
    view
    change
    add
    delete

These permissions are created each time you run migrate command

to test for basic permissions you should use:
    permission to add: user.has_perm('app_name.add_Model')
    permission to change: user.has_perm('app_name.change_Model')
